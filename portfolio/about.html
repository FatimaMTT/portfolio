                Hello, my name is Fatima. I was born and raised in Mexico City, Mexico. I studied Media Arts Production at Emerson College, and I am a rising animator. During my time at Emerson, I served as a Production Assistant for three student films, I played a secondary character in Emerson’s first spanish-language play, and I was a crew member for three Emerson Channel shows. I was also involved in a few organizations at Emerson: I was an Executive Board member of Emerson’s Latino and Hispanic organization AMIGOS for a year and a half, and I was a memeber of Emerson’s animation organization Sweet Tooth Animation. During my sophomore and junior  years I was a Lab Assistant at the Digital Post Production labs, and later on I became a Lab Manager. As a student I co-produced a live-action short and my BFA thesis project, which is a 3D animated short, and both of these projects are currently in post-production. I am currently working on a freelance project, and I will share more about it soon!
