            Hello, my name is Fatima. I was born and raised in Mexico City, Mexico. I am a Media Arts Production student at Emerson College, focusing my career on animation. During my time at Emerson, I have served as a Production Assistant for three student films, I played a secondary character in Emerson’s first spanish play, and I was a crew member for three Emerson Channel shows. I have also been involved in a few organizations at Emerson: I was an Executive Board member of Emerson’s Latino and Hispanic organization AMIGOS for a year and a half, and I was also a memeber of Emerson’s animation organization Sweet Tooth Animation. I am currently a Lab Manager at the Digital Post Production labs at Emerson, and I am also producing a short live action film and my BFA thesis film, which is 3D animated.
